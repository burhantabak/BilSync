## Motivation

The motivation is the need for a web application where every Bilkenter can share their thoughts anonymously or publicly. 
Not only can they share their opinions, but this app will also be the platform of exchange and solidarity in Bilkent.

## Problem

Bilkent members use many apps to share their thoughts, notify the community, and cooperate. 
Our application provides a single platform for Bilkenters to connect in various ways.
Bilkenters use a so-called Instagram confession page where people send messages to the page admin, and the admin posts the sent messages to a public page.
Bilkenters also use letgo, Facebook, this Instagram page, or Sahibinden to sell their used materials to other users, probably from Bilkent.
This all-over-the-place communication style sometimes disserves the community and inhibits effective interaction, and thus, the Bilkent community needs a united page for Bilkenters only in which people can do all of these in one place.


## Goals

The web application will contain the Lost & Found feature, where the retrieval process 
for lost items will be faster and safer. 
An Exchange feature will be implemented, which will be used for students who change their sections or the course they
take and can swap the books and material they own with others. 
There will also be the option to donate books from the generous Bilkenters.

The students will be able to post messages, images, and videos like they are using a social marketplace and media 
application and be able to chat with others both privately and publicly. We will also provide Bilkenters with a 
two-factor authentication feature to avoid security leaks and provide a more secure web application. Also, for those who 
have difficulties checking if their sections and courses fit in the weekly schedule by hand, we plan to help the
user with the feature to provide available sections and courses, greatly helping them and saving them even hours.
In addition, people can message in private rooms, managing communication more quickly than trying to find someone
in WhatsApp groups for hours.

Lastly, the application will be available for everyone, including our instructors, so we also plan to add beneficial
features for them! 
Instead of instructors having their inboxes filled with student questions, they can talk with students more freely here.
Different from the direct messaging feature, the students can send what they want through a private request to the
instructor. This will save time and space usage for each instructor and student.
Also, if possible, we plan to publish our web application in mobile platforms as well!

## Selling Points

The web application will compensate for the need for a 2<sup>nd</sup> trade online platform in Bilkent. 
Since it is Bilkent network only, this app will be secure, our most fundamental selling point. 
Further, making this platform a social place where everyone can send their ideas anonymously 
further increases the uniqueness of our app.

## Interesting/Cool Points

This app will contain features that will allow students to interact with each other, trade, and sell their products. 
Additionally, there will be forums where students can have private/public posts to allow them to enjoy and socialize 
with people. Students can make their profiles private or public while displaying their departments and hobbies in 
their biographies. This feature will allow them to find friends more compatible with their interests. The app will have
generic content that can provide additional new features. UI will be user-friendly, attracting students inclined
to use the app.
